what is proxy?
    there are 2 types of proxy: forward proxy and reverse proxy(proxy proxy)
    forward proxy:
        present b/w client and the internet
        sends request on behalf of the client using server's ip
        hides client from server and internet
    reverse proxy:
        stands b/w internet and server
        hides server from direct exposer to internet/client
        reverse proxy consist of WAF, loadbalancing, CDN's and autoscaling
            WAF: is defined using the rules in the Web control list
            mainly used for prevent DDOS attacks at network layer and
                add rateLimiter and captcha/image based authentication at application layer
        the tools that provide these services are cloudflare etc
    note: vpn/vpc comes into play only when the employee wants to access services

why domain registration and dns is important from user perspective?
    when you send a request from user to server, the data may be in risk by getting man in the middle attack
    so when you send a request to that you want to send a data, the server sends you a openBox
        with publicKey attached and itself store the private key(Asymmetric cryptography)
        1. so data/accessKey is placed inside openBox and locked using publicKey 
        2. the attacker only sees the publicKey encrypted box to which he doesn't have the privateKey
        3. once the accessKey reaches the server it opens the box with it's privateKey
        4. once they have accessKey they discard the publicKey/privateKey and communicate through accessKey
            for faster interaction
    although this method seems foolproof, Their is a major bug called spoofing
        where the attacker acts as fake client and fake server
    now we dive into our main concept of domain:
        once a domain is registered, you provide it with the CA certificate
            the certificate is not simply provided you need to perform certain tasks like
            addingFile to DNS and perform other events which only owner of the file can perform
        the certificates are provided by authorized company's like digicert, microsoft
        1.users rises a https request where he requests to establish connection
        2.then server wraps its publicKey with the server side certificate and sends which cannot be decoded by attacker
        3:when the user receives the response,
            user's browser/os has all the client side certificates from these authorized certificate providers inBuilt
            through which they verify the certificate
    now you might say that the attacker can get his own domain and add certificate
        1.yes but when he interrupts server message and sends his own publicKey wrapped by his server side certificate
            cause he won't be having access to server side certificate of og server
        2.then when the client decodes the certificate you receive a different domain from the og domain
        3.then the server screams back to you that this site is "not secure"
